<!-- last: 788b29b9ab5268d81217e49ffe2de01a87ad0ea0 -->

**2025-12-03** — **Live Audio Visualization** — `8edd3ef`
> The project came to life: WASAPI loopback capture feeding a real-time circular waveform renderer. AudioJones exists.

**2025-12-12** — **Shader Post-Processing Pipeline** — `ac49b80`
> A fractal feedback effect introduced the first GPU fragment shader pass, establishing the post-processing pipeline that would become the project's core architecture.

**2025-12-13** — **LFO Automation Engine** — `11d2e98`
> Parameters could now be automated over time by low-frequency oscillators, turning static knobs into living, breathing motion.

**2025-12-14** — **GPU Compute Simulations** — `d6e43ed`
> Physarum slime mold brought the first compute shader simulation, adding a fundamentally new rendering paradigm where autonomous agents create emergent visual patterns.

**2025-12-21** — **Dear ImGui Migration** — `e6130d0`
> The primitive raygui controls were replaced with Dear ImGui's docking panel system, enabling the complex multi-panel interface the growing effect library demanded.

**2025-12-23** — **MilkDrop Feedback Pipeline** — `5209e3c`
> A MilkDrop-style feedback system let previous frames feed back into rendering with spatial flow fields, enabling the self-reinforcing evolving visuals that define the project's aesthetic.

**2025-12-26** — **Audio-Reactive Modulation Routing** — `c5c0497`
> A modulation routing engine connected audio analysis features to any visual parameter, making the entire effect chain genuinely audio-reactive rather than manually animated.

**2026-01-04** — **User-Reorderable Effect Chain** — `d8b25ad`
> Transform effects became a user-reorderable chain with drag-and-drop UI, turning the fixed processing pipeline into a composable signal flow where users design their own visual recipes.

**2026-02-01** — **Procedural Generator Effects** — `a759a5a`
> Constellation became the first procedural generator, a new effect class that creates visuals from nothing rather than transforming existing imagery, spawning an entire category of FFT-reactive pattern generators.

**2026-02-03** — **Self-Contained Effect Modules** — `25263a2`
> Effects became isolated modules each owning their config, shaders, init/uninit, and parameter registration, replacing monolithic management and enabling the project to scale from a handful of effects to 77+.

**2026-02-12** — **Automated Release Pipeline** — `2d7d94d`
> GitHub Actions CI builds and publishes releases from git tags, making AudioJones a distributable product beyond the developer's machine.
