# Implementation Progress: Radial Pulse

## Phase 1: Config and Shader
- Status: completed
- Started: 2026-01-12
- Completed: 2026-01-12
- Files modified:
  - src/config/radial_pulse_config.h
  - shaders/radial_pulse.fs
- Notes: Created config struct with radialFreq, radialAmp, segments, angularAmp, phaseSpeed, spiralTwist. Shader implements displacement vector algorithm with radial rings and angular petals.

## Phase 2: Integration
- Status: pending

## Phase 3: UI and Modulation
- Status: pending

## Phase 4: Serialization
- Status: pending
