# Implementation Progress: Effects Panel Reorganization

## Phase 1: Add Group Header Widget
- Status: completed
- Completed: 2026-01-07
- Files modified:
  - src/ui/imgui_widgets.cpp
  - src/ui/imgui_panels.h
- Notes: Added DrawGroupHeader() with "Neon Horizon" design - horizontal accent line with glow underline, accent-colored text. Visually distinct from section headers by using horizontal line (not vertical bar) and no background fill.

## Phase 2: Restructure Effects Panel Layout
- Status: pending

## Phase 3: Polish and Spacing
- Status: pending
