# Writing Effect Descriptions

One sentence describing what the viewer SEES, not what the shader DOES.

## Examples

| Bad (algorithm) | Good (visual) |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Ray-sphere intersection with spherical UV tiling and facet normal perturbation | Classic disco ball spinning against black, tiny mirrors catching fragments of the scene |
| Golden-angle Vogel disc blur with brightness weighting for bright pixel emphasis | Dreamy out-of-focus blur where bright spots become soft glowing circles like city lights at night |
| Wedge-based radial mirroring with polar coordinate transforms | Symmetrical pattern radiating from center like looking through a toy kaleidoscope |
| Gradient-derived normal mapping with diffuse and specular shading | Thick impasto brush strokes with glossy paint surface catching the light |
| Computes voronoi geometry with multiple blendable cell-based effects | Organic cell/bubble patterns with various shading modes |
| Edge detection with directional strokes and paper texture overlay | Hand-drawn graphite shading on rough paper |
| Applies Sobel filter with granulation noise and color bleed passes | Sumi-e brush painting where ink pools dark along contours |
